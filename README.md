This paper uses a cross-sectional regression methodology to analyse the demographic characteristics of 179 countries and examine their significance in explaining the number of
confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths per capita. The dataset used consists of 59 country characteristics spanning areas including economics, the environment and societal indicators for the 13th April 2020. The dataset was constructed using information collated from three online sources.

Three unique ordinary least squares (OLS) regression approaches were used to determine which predictor variables have a statistically significant relationship with the dependent variables of interest. I find that ‘Total Greenhouse Gas Emissions’ is a significant factor in explaining both the total number of confirmed cases and deaths per capita in two of the three approaches used. Urban Population as a % of total population and the proportion of people using safely managed drinking water services are also good predictors of total cases per capita.

These results nicely reflect the conclusions of other recent studies by (Martelletti and Martelletti, 2020) and (Wu, C Nethery, Braun and Dominici, 2020) which indicate that air
pollution has a significant impact on the COVID-19 death rate. This outlines that further analysis of this relationship is required.
